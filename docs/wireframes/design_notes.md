NOTES FOR THE WIREFRAMES OF SPRINT 2 - Home page, Category Intro page, Header and Footer

Notes for the Homepage:
1. The homepage is just Title, Content paragraph, and a button that leads to the Category Page.
2. We can add more later of course, but that's the bare bones of it.

Notes for Category Info: 
1. Don't worry about what the Title or Explanation paragraph say, just know that there will be a Title and explanation but you can code it with nonsense words at first.
2.A. "Choose a Role" is a button that when selected, displays a dropdown menu of all the roles. 
2.B.  If the user clicks on a role, there should be some styling to show that the role is selected (ex. color change) 
3. Only one role can be selected at once
4. The "Continue" button cannot be clicked until a role has been selected

Notes for the Header: 
1. There will be a logo or app name in the left hand corner, and that leads to home. 
2.Then on the right you have a "Home" button and a "Roles" button that leads to Category Intro page. I personally don't care what you call the "Roles" button
3. Also for what it's worth, I don't actually expect the header to look like this, the logo probably won't take up 40% of the width of it

Notes for the Footer: 
1. You have to list all the names- I drew them as 2 columns, but for mobile it's probably just to do 1 column and stack all 7 names.
2. I'm assuming we all want both our github and Linkedin links with our names but that is optional. I also think it would be nice to have a profile picture with each name but that's very optional.
3. Github Logo/Link to the project repo at the bottom. Linking to Chingu is optional.
